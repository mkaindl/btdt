/// A storage is a place where files are stored, for example the local filesystem.
///
/// Paths are expected to use `/` as the path separator and to be absolute within the storage
/// (this could, however, map to a path relative to some base directory within the filesystem).
///
/// For reading and writing files, a [Storage::Reader] and [Storage::Writer] are returned,
/// respectively.
/// This allows interacting with the file data without loading the full file content into memory.
/// However, as a written file must become available atomically, the `Writer` must implement
/// [Close] to finalize the write operation.
///
/// Note that the storage implementation must support parallel access from other `btdt` processes.
/// This means that even the return values of the trait methods may change in-between calls.
/// For implementors, it means that a sufficient degree of atomicity must be ensured, especially
/// when reading or writing files.
